For this directory, a local setup is needed as well as you need to download the ImageNet-1k validation set. The structure should resemble what's specified in here - [`imagenet_results/imagenet_o/README.md`](https://github.com/sayakpaul/robustness-vit/tree/master/imagenet_results/imagenet_o#readme). The Jupyter Notebooks need to be run locally for this experiment. 

First, clone this repository (https://github.com/jeonsworld/ViT-pytorch) and install he requirements. Additional Python library requirements are in `requirements.txt`.
