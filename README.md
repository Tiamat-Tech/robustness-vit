## Structure and Navigation

All the results related to the ImageNet datasets (ImageNet-C, ImageNet-P, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, ImageNet-O, and ImageNet-9) can be derived from the notebooks contained in the [`imagenet_results`] (Link to be updated) directory. Many notebooks inside that directory can be executed with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). When that is not the case, we provide execution instructions explicitly. This is followed for the rest of the directories present inside this repository. 

[`analysis`] (Link to be updated) directory contains the code used to generate results for Section 4 in the paper. 

[`misc`](Link to be updated) directory contains the code for visualizing frequency artifacts inside images. 

## About our dev environment

We use Python 3.8. As for the hardware setup (when not using Colab), we use a [GCP AI Platform Notebook](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-notebooks) with 4 V100s, 60 GBs of RAM with 16 vCPUs (`n1-standard-16` machine type).
